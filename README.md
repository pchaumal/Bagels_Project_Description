**Project: Bagels - A Deductive Logic Game**

### Description:
Developed a Python-based interactive game that challenges players to guess a secret number using logical deductions. The game provides feedback through specific clues indicating whether digits are correct and in the right position, correct but in the wrong position, or not present at all.

### Key Features:
- **Random Number Generation:** Utilizes a function to generate a unique, non-repetitive 3-digit number for each game session.
- **User Interaction:** Engages players with a limited number of guesses to deduce the secret number, enhancing the challenge and excitement.
- **Clue System:** Implements a clue mechanism (Pico, Fermi, Bagels) to guide players towards the correct guess.
- **Replayability:** Allows players to start new games after each round, promoting continuous engagement.

### Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `random`

### Contributions:
- Designed and developed the entire game logic and user interface.
- Implemented robust input validation to ensure user entries are appropriate.
- Created a clear and user-friendly guide to assist players in understanding the game's rules and feedback system.
